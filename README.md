# Off the Walls!
A Unity project I started as a challenge to create a game-prototype that matches the theme "construct and destroy" in one week. Unity-Version: 2019.4.14f1

The builds of this game turned out to be pretty buggy, on top of that was my knowledge of OOP to low to write performant code when I started it, so it's all kinda messy.
So I stopped working on the project and instead started a new one. But the game is playable in the Unity editor.
